Logger::Unixout
===============

This gem provides a fairly simple subclass that implements a "Unixy"
to messages produced using a logger interface, namely:

* Informational and debugging messages are printed to stdout
* Warnings, errors and fatal messages are printed to stderr
* Output is human-friendly (no big timestamps or letter
  severity codes)
